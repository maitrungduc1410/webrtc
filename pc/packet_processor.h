// stays protocol-agnostic and simply forwards packets through the two transform
// methods below.

// This is currently a minimal stub: it only frames the application payload with
// a transport header. Congestion-control feedback carried inside that framing
// is intentionally left out until its wire format has been agreed upon, at
// which point parsed feedback will be surfaced out-of-band (not through a
// return value) so the caller never has to reason about it.
//
// All methods run on the network thread.
