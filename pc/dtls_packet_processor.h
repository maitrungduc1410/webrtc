// Implements the wire format of the DTLS-only RtcTransport mode
// (WireProtocol::kDtlsWithFeedback).
//
// Every DTLS payload begins with a 1-byte packet type:
//   0x01 Data only : [type][seq(2)][app payload]
// Reserved values (0x00, 0x02-0xFF) are dropped with a warning; they are set
// aside for the congestion-control feedback wire format, which is not yet
// defined (its format is still under discussion) and will be added in a
// follow-up.
//
// The transport sequence number is carried now so that future feedback can
// report on packets sent by this stub without a wire-format change.
//
// The sender wraps each application payload in a transport header via
// ProcessOutgoingPacket(); the receiver strips it via ProcessIncomingPacket(),
// which returns the application payload (sharing storage with the input, no
// copy). All methods run on the network thread.
