// PeerConnectionTracerInterface is a passive, signaling-thread observer of
// PeerConnection lifecycle and operation events. It is intended for
// diagnostics and trace surfaces (e.g. chrome://webrtc-internals); it must
// not influence PeerConnection behaviour.
//
// Threading: every method is invoked on the PeerConnection's signaling
// thread. Implementations must not block; opening each method with
// RTC_DCHECK_DISALLOW_THREAD_BLOCKING_CALLS() (rtc_base/thread.h) is
// strongly recommended to catch accidental blocking calls in debug builds.
//
// Lifetime: an implementation is supplied via PeerConnectionDependencies at
// construction time and is owned by the PeerConnection for its entire
// lifetime. It cannot be reset or replaced.
//
// All methods are pure virtual: embedders must spell out every event,
// using `{}` for the ones they don't care about. Adding a method here is
// a breaking change for every implementer.
//
// Payloads are passed by const pointer/reference into long-lived objects
// owned by the PeerConnection. The tracer must not retain these pointers
// past the call; it should serialize lazily, only on demand. Passing
// pointers (rather than pre-serialized strings) keeps the cost near zero
// when no tracer is attached or when a particular event is unobserved.
//
// This interface is not the place to observe per-message data-channel
// traffic; use DataChannelEventObserverInterface for that. An embedder
// that wants both can install both at construction time.
